# Utilities

This folder contains the cross-platform WSIWindow utility, for creating a Vulkan window.
It provides callbacks for mouse, keyboard and multi-touch events,and works on Windows, Linux and Android.

Please see the docs in the WSIWindow folder, for more details.

There are two demos that show how to use WSIWindow:

 - `WSIWindow_Sample1` creates a Vulkan window, and shows how to handle keyboard, mouse, touch and window events.
 - `/Sample-Programs/Hologram` has been updated to use the WSIWindow utility.
